--> Cats is a library which provides abstraction for functional programming in scala
--> Cats are written using the modular structure, which allows us to choose which type of class,
    instance, and the interface we want to use
--> Based on 1.) Type Classes, 2.) Implicits

--> Monads, and related concepts, are the functional programming equivalent
    of object‐oriented design patterns—architectural building blocks that turn up
    over and over again in code. They differ from object‐oriented patterns in two
    main ways:
    • they are formally, and thus precisely, defined; and
    • they are extremely (extremely) general.
