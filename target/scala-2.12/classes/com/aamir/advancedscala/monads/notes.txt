-->Monads are a category of data types. Informally, anything that has a type parameter, a constructor that takes an
  element of that type,and a flatMap method (which has to obey certain laws) is a monad.
   A monad is a mechanism for sequencing computations.


--> A monad is a container with operations (map/flatMap/filter/foreach) that can act on the contents
    without extracting it first.

--> law1: left-identity: unit(x).flatMap(f) == f(x)
--> law2: right-identity: aMonadInstance.flatMap(unit) == aMonadInstance
--> law3: associativity: m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g) = m.flatMap(x => f(x).flatMap(g))
